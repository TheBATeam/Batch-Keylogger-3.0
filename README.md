 # HOW TO MAKE A KEYLOGGER IN NOTEPAD YOURSELF? 
The newer version of  Batch Keylogger is out for your precious feedback. You can simply write a few lines of commands in a simple text file and make a keylogger in notepad yourself! We’ve launched **version 3.0** of the keylogger, it is more advanced than the previous version.

Older versions had some bugs and they were not able to detect the key presses of few special keys – such as **“Arrow Keys, Function keys, Delete key, Insert key, Home key”** etc.

But, this version can easily detect almost all kinds of **key-presses** from the keyboard, and returns the string code corresponding to that, on the **cmd screen**. You can use that information to save and then manipulate later as per the requirement of your work!

# LIMITATIONS IN KEYLOGGER 3.0:
As in the old DIY keylogger 1.0, we used ‘choice.exe or choice.com‘ for logging pressed keys on the keyboard, and we’ve used **‘mChoice.exe‘** (written in C by kvc) for the keylogger 2.0 – same reason for using **‘fn.dll‘** file in this version 3.0 (i.e. to fulfill our requirement)

Using plugins make your life much easier than going deep into the older code, as ultimately your main aim is to fulfill your requirements. Plugins provide you a better and cleaner way of fulfilling your requirements via simple implementation.

This is the reason, we don’t hesitate from using plugins in batch programs, as they result in a beautiful batch program sometimes.
